I went to school on time. I went to computer science and I accidentally solved the pyramix duo 3 times by accident. I went and bought pizza for lunch even though I already brought one with me. My friends bought me a Monster Drink in english class to make me get hyper. I had a bad caffiene crash. I took the bus home and then got home.
